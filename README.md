# Labelling_test

This is a quick program built to label a series of images with a pre-determined set of labels.

Currently works locally with an interactive plot shown in browser.

To use, first create an environment and install packages from the requirements.txt file 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once installed, activate the environment and run the following:

```
bokeh serve --show Labelling.py
```

From here the interactive plot should open in your browser
